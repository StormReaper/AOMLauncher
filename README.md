<h1>Installation</h1>

To Install simply go to your AOM:EE Installation folder, most commonly found at:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Age of Mythology

And either replace the Launcher file or make a backup of the original. You can always validate your game files through steam so a backup is entirely optional.
